### Welcome on My Github! ðŸ˜º

I'm working as a Software Tester, mostly manual one, but I like to automize tasks, whatever I can. I do it mostly to optimize my daily work and develop myself with automation tools. Why? Because:

I like do things in a efficient way
I love to learn new things
I like to put a some effort to minimalize work to do in the future (for myself and other people)
I like to finding disfunctional things and bugs
I also studing Computer Science at weeekends, where I learn about general fields of IT sector, learn how to use programming languages (C#, Javacript), working with Databases (Postgre, MySQL) and also build a website applications using HTML 5 and CSS.

After hours I love coooking, board games and cats.
